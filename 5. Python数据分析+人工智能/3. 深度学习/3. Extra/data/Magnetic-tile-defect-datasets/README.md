It is welcomed to use our dataset. And if it is used in your research, please cite our paper. 

A toolbox for surface defects saliency detection can be reach at [https://github.com/abin24/Saliency-detection-toolbox](https://github.com/abin24/Saliency-detection-toolbox). In which our MCue and 14 other saliency detection models are available.
