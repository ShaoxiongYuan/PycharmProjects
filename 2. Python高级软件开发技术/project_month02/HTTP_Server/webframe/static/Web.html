The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources
are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by
hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the WWW are transferred via the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published
by a software application called a web server.
